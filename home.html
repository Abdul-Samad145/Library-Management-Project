         <p> <h2><span>Introduction </span></h2>
            <br>
            The Institute of Management Sciences (IMSciences) Library came into being with the inception of IMSciences in 1995. From 1995 to December 31st 2001, the library remained inside the premises of the University of Peshawar. In January 2002, however, IMSciences moved to Hayatabad Peshawar where initially the library comprised of two small rooms. In August 2007, however, the library shifted to phase 7, where again a temporary but wide hall was allotted to the Library. In September 2010 the library finally shifted to its own new building on 5th floor of the Academic Block.
